# Sorting, Edit Distance, Priority Queue, and Graph Algorithms

## Overview
This project implements fundamental algorithms in C and Java, including:

- **Sorting algorithms**: Generic implementations of Quicksort and Mergesort in C.
- **Edit Distance algorithm**: A generic implementation in C to compute the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another.
- **Generic Priority Queue**: A priority queue implemented in Java, allowing generic data types.
- **Graph with Generic Nodes and Edges**: A graph data structure in Java, supporting different node and edge types.
- **Prim's Algorithm for Maze Generation**: An application of the graph structure, using Prim’s algorithm to generate random labyrinths.

## Features
### C Implementations
- **Quicksort**: A generic implementation of the Quicksort algorithm.
- **Mergesort**: A generic implementation of the Mergesort algorithm.
- **Edit Distance**: Computes the minimum edit distance between two strings using dynamic programming.

### Java Implementations
